# landing_page_project
This is my first ever webpage styled with css. By completing this assignment, I am logically finishing the css and html sections of The Odin Project's foundations. That is represented as 61% of the whole course, which took me around 35 days (3h per day). I am more than satisfied with my results, because I've already learned so much. 

What have I learned particularly in this project:

1. HTML:

- Including semantic elements such as nav, header, footer, section to make my code more structured
- Linking a style.css document to my index.html
- Got more comfortable with using lots of div elements and classes
- How to open links in a new tab

2. CSS:

- Understood the need for adding "css reset" (padding: 0; margin: 0; box-sizing: border-box)
- Nesting different elements + attention to "*" and "body" small adjustments
- How to use a custom font
- Working with height and width (*BUT STILL NEED TO PRACTICE THEM MORE*)
- Flexbox (probably was the most confusing thing I've looked at so far, so it took me some time xD)
- Styling lists and links so that they look better
- Rounded corners for divs, buttons
- More responsiveness for a page while resizing (@media)
- Had a couple attempts to optimize my code after some commits, but I still have so much stuff to learn (it's probably all about writing "quality" code)
- Reflected enough on adding my own features (like a logo spin animation) and tried to make it more personal with my own ideas

3. Other:

- Importance to give credit to people's photos, being careful with copyright stuff
- How to approach a project from the scratch while slowly having it being built up

Overall, it was a nice experience. I am definitely starting to *feel* something towards web-development. So I gotta maintain my interest and consistency to move forward.
