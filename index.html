                <div class="secondary">Prague is the capital of not the biggest country in Europe - Czech Republic - yet it has too much historic heritage for its small area. So visiting this city at some point is a no-brainer. It has something for <em>Everyone.</em></div>

                    <p>Night Prague is such a romantic place, with its own charm. Once it gets dark, the city starts shining differently than during the day. The city center is well-lighted, so taking a walk after a busy day is indeed a good choice.</p>

                    <p>Locals usually say, "To get the best view of Prague, one needs to climb somewhere and become a bird for an instant." Fortunately, there are a bunch of spots from which observing red roofs and ancient castles is so much fun.</p>

                    <p>People are naturally divided into two groups - early birds and night owls. So while enjoying Prague at night might be a more common choice, morning Prague is not less fascinating. The best thing is having the fabulous center only for yourself.</p>

                    <p>It's crazy to think how much attention our ancestors paid to very small details. Plenty of old castles, facades, bridges, statues were meant to be maintained for many centuries yet to come. So it's always worth to stop by and genuinely appreciate art.</p>
